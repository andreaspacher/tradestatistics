<p>This vignette explains the functions within this package. The idea is to show how this package simplifies obtaining data from (api.tradestatistics.io)[<a href="https://api.tradestatistics.io" class="uri">https://api.tradestatistics.io</a>].</p>
<p>To improve the presentation of the tables I shall use <code>DT</code> and the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/DT/man/datatable.html">datatable()</a></code> function besides <code>tradestatistics</code>.</p>

<p>Provided that this package obtains data from an API, it is useful to know which tables can be accessed:</p>

The letters indicate the presence of columns that account for the level of detail in the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>y</code>: <em>y</em>ear column.</li>
<li>
<code>r</code>: <em>r</em>eporter column</li>
<li>
<code>p</code>: <em>p</em>artner column</li>
<li>
<code>c</code>: product <em>c</em>ode column</li>
</ul>
<p>The most aggregated table is <code>yr</code> which basically says how many dollars each country exports and imports for a given year.</p>
<p>The less aggregated table is <code>yrpc</code> which says how many dollars of each of the 1,222 products from the Harmonized System each country exports to other countries and imports from other countries.</p>

<div id="country-codes" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#country-codes" class="anchor"></a>Country codes</h2>
<p>The Package Functions section explains that you don’t need to memorize all ISO codes. The functions within this package are designed to match strings (i.e. “United States” or “America”) to valid ISO codes (i.e. “USA”).</p>
<p>Just as a reference, the table with all valid ISO codes can be accessed by running this:</p>
