# Version 0.2.1

Fixes

* Consistent use of colour vs color, color is used from now
* Fixed available tables description
* Adds `yrp_short` to available tables
* Adds `use_localhost` option for our own server or users who want to clone the
  database locally, therefore avoid having a separate branh for server installation
