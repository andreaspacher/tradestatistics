<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This vignette explains the functions within this package. The idea is to show how this package simplifies obtaining data from (api.tradestatistics.io)[<a href="https://api.tradestatistics.io" class="uri">https://api.tradestatistics.io</a>].</p>
<p>To improve the presentation of the tables I shall use <code>DT</code> and the <code>datatable()</code> function besides <code>tradestatistics</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tradestatistics)</span>

<h1>Package data</h1>
<div id="available-tables" class="section level2">
<h2>Available tables</h2>
<p>Provided that this package obtains data from an API, it is useful to know which tables can be accessed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">datatable</span>(ots_tables)</span></code></pre></div>
<div id="htmlwidget-76c6a9982550cb05ea50" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-76c6a9982550cb05ea50">{"x":{"filter":"none","extensions":["FixedColumns"],"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14"],["countries","reporters","partners","products","products_shortnames","products_communities","yrpc","yrp","yrc","yr","yr-communities","yr-groups","yc","years"],["Countries metadata","Reporters for a given year","Partners for a given year","Products metadata","Products short names","Products communities","Reporter-Partner trade at product level (Year, Reporter, Partner and Product Code)","Reporter-Partner trade at aggregated level (Year, Reporter and Partner)","Reporter trade at product level (Year, Reporter and Product Code)","Reporter trade at aggregated level (Year and Reporter)","Reporter trade at product community level (Year, Reporter and Product Community) (22 communities)","Reporter trade at product group level (Year, Reporter and Product Group) (99 groups)","Product trade at detailed level (Year and Product Code)","Minimum and maximum years with available data"],["UN Comtrade (with modifications)","UN Comtrade (with modifications)","UN Comtrade (with modifications)","Center for International Development at Harvard University (with modifications)","Center for International Development at Harvard University (with modifications)","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics","Open Trade Statistics"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>table<\/th>\n      <th>description<\/th>\n      <th>source<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"Bfrtip","scrollX":true,"fixedColumns":{"leftColumns":2,"rightColumns":1},"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>You might notice the tables have a pattern. The letters indicate the presence of columns that account for the level of detail in the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>y</code>: <em>y</em>ear column.</li>
<li><code>r</code>: <em>r</em>eporter column</li>
<li><code>p</code>: <em>p</em>artner column</li>
<li><code>c</code>: <em>c</em>ommodity column</li>
</ul>
<p>The most aggregated table is <code>yr</code> which basically says how many dollars each country exports and imports for a given year.</p>
<p>The less aggregated table is <code>yrpc</code> which says how many dollars of each of the 1,242 commodities from the Harmonized System each country exports to other countries and imports from other countries.</p>
<p>For the complete detail you can check <a href="https://docs.tradestatistics.io">docs.tradestatistics.io</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="country-codes" class="section level2">
<h2>Country codes</h2>
<p>The Package Functions section explains that you don’t need to memorize all ISO codes. The functions within this package are designed to match strings (i.e. “United States” or “America”) to valid ISO codes (i.e. “USA”).</p>
<p>Just as a reference, the table with all valid ISO codes can be accessed by running this:</p>

<p>The function <code>ots_country_code()</code> is used by <code>ots_create_tidy_data()</code> in a way that you can pass parameters like <code>ots_create_tidy_data(... reporters = &quot;Chile&quot; ...)</code> and it will automatically replace your input for a valid ISO in case there is a match. This will be covered in detail in the Trade Data section.</p>

<p>The <code>yrpc</code> table returns some fields that deserve an explanation which can be seen at <a href="https://docs.tradestatistics.io">docs.tradestatistics.io</a>. This example is interesting because “01” return a set of commodities (all commodities starting with 01, which is the commodity group “Animals; live”), but “food” return all commodities with a matching description (“1601”, “1806”, “1904”, etc.). In addition, not all the requested commodities are exported from each reporter to each partner, therefore a warning is returned.</p>
