<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This vignette explains the functions within this package. The idea is to show how this package simplifies obtaining data from (api.tradestatistics.io)[<a href="https://api.tradestatistics.io" class="uri">https://api.tradestatistics.io</a>].</p>
<p>To improve the presentation of the tables I shall use <code>DT</code> and the <code>datatable()</code> function besides <code>tradestatistics</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tradestatistics)</span>

<h2>Available tables</h2>
<p>Provided that this package obtains data from an API, it is useful to know which tables can be accessed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">datatable</span>(ots_tables)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You might notice the tables have a pattern. The letters indicate the presence of columns that account for the level of detail in the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>y</code>: <em>y</em>ear column.</li>
<li><code>r</code>: <em>r</em>eporter column</li>
<li><code>p</code>: <em>p</em>artner column</li>
<li><code>c</code>: <em>c</em>ommodity column</li>
</ul>
<p>The most aggregated table is <code>yr</code> which basically says how many dollars each country exports and imports for a given year.</p>
<p>The less aggregated table is <code>yrpc</code> which says how many dollars of each of the 1,242 commodities from the Harmonized System each country exports to other countries and imports from other countries.</p>
<p>For the complete detail you can check <a href="https://tradestatistics.io">tradestatistics.io</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="country-codes" class="section level2">
<h2>Country codes</h2>
<p>The Package Functions section explains that you don’t need to memorize all ISO codes. The functions within this package are designed to match strings (i.e. “United States” or “America”) to valid ISO codes (i.e. “USA”).</p>
<p>Just as a reference, the table with all valid ISO codes can be accessed by running this:</p>

<p>The <code>yrpc</code> table returns some fields that deserve an explanation which can be seen at <a href="https://tradestatistics.io">tradestatistics.io</a>. This example is interesting because “01” return a set of commodities (all commodities starting with 01, which is the commodity group “Animals; live”), but “food” return all commodities with a matching description (“1601”, “1806”, “1904”, etc.). In addition, not all the requested commodities are exported from each reporter to each partner, therefore a warning is returned.</p>
